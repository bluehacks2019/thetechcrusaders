About ERA: 

I. Application Description:

	Since our theme is self care for student, we created an application which focuses on how they will took care of their security and safetiness specially when emergency occurs. It allows you to send a request on the nearest rescuer within the area. Users whom find themselves in an unknown location that can’t be described or provide an accurate address when emergency
occurs,casualties which caused by the late arrival of rescuers and searching for an available nearby ambulance have been some of the hustling factor that faced by current fast pace community. This application will help the user to get the ambulance, fire truck and police mobiles without calling the departments to check for the availability of these emergency vehicles. The application reacts with just one tab on the button and it will send the notification of user’s details and location via GPS to nearby rescuer. Then it’s the rescuer’s hand to approve the requested notification. Once the request is accepted, the GPS location will be send to the rescuer which will lead to the user location. It also helps to prevent fraud calls who misuse the application by diverting the service for better needy.

These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language. JSON is built on two structures:A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. (http://www.json.org/)
